This annual Doodle celebrates Argentina Independence Day, or 9 de Julio! On this day in 1816, the Congress of Tucumán gathered in northern Argentina to declare the nation’s independence from Spain.

Today, citizens attend lively events in cities like Buenos Aires, Resistencia, Formosa, and Tucumán. Many dress in light-blue-and-white outfits to honor the national flag, just like the one waving in today’s artwork. Food plays an important role on this holiday, and popular dishes like locro (a robust stew consisting of beans, corn, squash, potato, and varieties of meat) and pastelitos (little pies) never fail to put a smile on festivalgoers’ faces.
